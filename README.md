SEMrush Backlinks API
===

> React and Node API to find the best and worst backlinks for a domain using SEMrush API

## Prerequisites

In order to download and run this application you'll need these programs:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js >= 11.9.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Running the app

Clone the project and execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/Mircoguidetti/SEMrush-backlinks-api.git
cd SEMrush-backlinks-api/
```

## First setup and  run the application

Install dependencies and run client and backend servers

```
> bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` will execute `npm install` for you installing client and backend dependencies and will run the servers. However you only need to run this command  for the first time when you've cloned the application. Afterwards it's preferable to start the servers using:

```
bash start-dev.sh
```

`start-dev.sh` will only run the servers without install the dependencies
